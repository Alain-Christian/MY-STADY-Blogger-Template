# General
This template is published with the intention of helping developers learn Blogger template code by example. It's not that I don't have time to write tutorials, I just don't enjoy it! There are no instructions; I assume you know what you're doing. This is not a generic template coded to run on any blog with few changes. Indeed, if you wish to run this on your blog—the license totally permits that—understand that you would need to change a lot.

So yeah, happy coding. I've left detailed notes in the commit logs.
